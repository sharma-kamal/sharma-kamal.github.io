I am a theoretical physicist in the area of quantum simulations on superconducting circuits, quantum many-body phenomena and quantum information. <!--My current work proposes a method to readout quantum correlations from a superconducting circuit.-->  

Before getting into Physics, I got my B. Tech. in Civil Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (India). After a short stint as a visiting student learning Physics at the Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, I started my grad school at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta. <!--My doctoral research investigated [one-dimensional many-body quantum systems](https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/62339).-->

I enjoy Movies, Music, and Physics!
